# A Stock Market Scraper And Analyzer:
## AIM:
  <p>The objective of this project is to write a script to scrape historical stock price data for specific tickers and analyze the data extracted by using machine learning models.<br>
  What i hope to learn in this project is how to apply what i have learned in theory to practice as well as learn a new programming language i.e R <br>
  The main motivation for commiting to this project was because the historical price data for stocks can be confusing and have unnecessary information which a layman might not need. Hence, I wanted to clean up the data and
  extract insightful data from it.</p>

## TO DO:
  <ul>Learn Syntax of R and how to scrape data via it using scripts and open source libraries</ul>
  <ul>Train and test a machine learning model in python using popular libraires like keras et. al.</ul>
  <ul>Make the code accesible and add proper documentation of the program and also provide a pretrained model</ul>
